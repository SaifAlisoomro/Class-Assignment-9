            The pace of technological change is accelerating, big players like
            Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and OpenAI are winning by providing
            infrastructure, large AI foundation models, frameworks, 3D Metaverse
            experiences, and massive distribution networks. Solopreneurs trained
            in this program will win by automating work typically outsourced to
            employees, by directly connecting to customers by eliminating the
            middleman, and by developing vertical metaverses, thus paving the
            way for the first billion-dollar valued solopreneur businesses. This
            program has the objective to train this new breed of billion-dollar
            solopreneurs. These solopreneurs will adopt the ultra-lean business
            model and work independently and will not need to hire employees or
            other team members.
